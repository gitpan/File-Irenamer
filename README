Irenamer
========

Interactive file renamer module allows filename changes from within
your favorite editor.  

It is most useful when complicated or one-time repetitive changes to a
directory or directory tree must be made but programmatic solutions are
probably not worth the time to implement.  Defaults to 'do not recurse'.

It exports a single function called InteractiveRename()

It assumes a Unix-like environment that exports $EDITOR.
If you're on Win32, Cygwin works well.  Otherwise you can try to set 
$ENV{EDITOR} in the code that calls InteractiveRename().

Verbose mode is highly recommended, at least initially, since there is no
prompting nor undo available.
